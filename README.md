# Balloon-Popping AR Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Balloon-Popping Game**, an exciting and immersive augmented reality (AR) experience built using Unity and the AR Foundation library. This project was developed by me and [**Zeynep**](https://github.com/ZeynepUstunn?tab=following), combining our creativity and technical skills to deliver a fun and challenging AR experience. In this fast-paced game, players are challenged to pop colorful balloons using darts, all while avoiding pesky unwanted objects like paper and fireballs. The game is triggered by an image target and is designed for Android devices. With only **1 minute** on the clock, the player must score as many points as possible by aiming carefully and making precise shots, all while the score and timer are displayed in real-time.

## Gameplay
Once the image target is detected, the game comes to life, presenting a virtual world full of flying balloons. Each balloon offers a different score—**red balloons give 30 points**, **blue balloons grant 20 points**, and **green balloons award 10 points**. However, be cautious! Unwanted objects, including paper and fireballs, randomly fall onto the screen. Hitting these objects results in a point deduction: **-10 for paper** and **-50 for fireballs**. The player’s score is dynamically updated, changing color to reflect positive or negative points. A fast-paced countdown and sound effects add to the excitement, while the game ends when the timer runs out, displaying the final score and providing an option to restart the game for another round of fun.
